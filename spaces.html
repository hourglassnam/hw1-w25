            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Last year, most study spaces required reservations, leaving many students feeling anxious about finding a quiet spot to focus. 
                Our mission is to make it easy for you to find and reserve designated study spaces, computer stations, 
                quiet spots for remote classes, or touchdown spaces between classes. 
                Whether you need a reservable spot or a walk-in space, weâ€™re here to help you navigate available options across campus.
